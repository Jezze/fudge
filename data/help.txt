To execute a program simply type the name of the program.

hello                       | Hello World!
ls                          | Print files in current working tree

A program does not use arguments. It only uses streams.

echo /data/help.txt         | Print content of help.txt to stdout
cd /                        | Change to root directory
cd /system/                 | Change to home directory (from anywhere)
cd system/                  | Change to home directory (from root)
